## Week 2
## Client Side Review & Node.js

### WHAT IS NODE.JS?
* Node.js is a JavaScript run-time environment, it includes everything you need to execute a program written in JavaScript.
* Node.js was created when JavaScript was extended from something you could only run in the browser to something you could run on your machine as a standalone application.
* JavaScript now has the capability to do things that other scripting languages like Python can do!


### WHAT IS NPM?
*  Node Package Manager
*  provides two main functionalities:
    *  **Online repositories** for node.js packages/modules which are searchable on search.nodejs.org
    *  **Command line utility** to install Node.js packages, do version management and dependency management of Node.js packages.
* NPM helps javascript developers load dependencies effectively. To load dependencies we just have to run a command in command prompt:
```javascript

npm install

```
* This command is finding a json file named as package.json in root directory to install all dependencies defined in the file.
